# Web-design-project
This is the first web application design project. The website is designed for the COVID-19 pandemic in which this website helps in providing jobs and daily needs in the household.

## Problem Statement:
The economic impact of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. India's growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the Ministry of Statistics. Many businesses running at tertiary sector are also affected by pandemic and not at a very good position. And even many of the citizens of India are not able to fulfill their basic needs for survival because of not getting enough goods and unemployment.

## Aim
To make a difference in economic growth and provide the necessary items across various homes, designing a digital solution for the problems mentioned above so that each and every citizen can fulfill their basic needs with necessary items.

## PHP and MySQL Connectivity
PHP and mysql connectivity is quite simple task because we have to go to localhost dashboard and from there we go to myPHPadmin page. On that page you have to create your database and table in it. Now you have to make a PHP file and in that you have to store database and localhost name in a variable which will be used everywhere when a mysql qyery will be executed.

## Data fetching via jquery/Ajax/PHP
First you access a content file on the server. This file is downloaded to your computer and the html is displayed by your browser. The file contains javascript which is also downloaded to your computer. The jquery javascript then executes and creates its own request to a script on the server that has access to the mysql database. It does this using AJAX. The file script recieves this data and finally updates the html content on the page dynamically!

## Form Validation
Form validation is done through javascript by making various functions for each filed in the form. We make these function and call these in the input fields with onchange() event so that the user will get the error on the spot only. We can regular expressions (REGEX) also for these validations.

## Session Handling
Session handling is the most important part of a web design application because a user should see only those pages which he/she can see after login. Session handling should be done on all the pages from where the user has been logged in. This can be done just by starting the session 3 at the top of the code and putting the whole code in an if condition that the session variable is not empty. So that is a user wants to see that page, he/she will be directed to the login page.

## Javascript functions
Javascript can be used to make different function for different features and can be called with events like onchange, onclick, onkeyup, ect. For example from footer part if we want to go to the top of the page so we will make a function in the script tag and call it in the onclick event.

## Final Concept
#### • The website homepage will have two options shopping and find jobs.
#### • In the shopping option the user can click on it and find the products for daily use category wise.
#### • After that he/she can select any product and can directly buy or can add to cart.
#### • After that if they select buy option they have to login/signup with their details and complete the payment option.
#### • And the order summary will get generated directly before the payment option so that the user can check and verify everything.
#### • Now in the find job option, we’re taking the details and demands of the company and the unemployed people who are looking for jobs. Before that they have to login/sign up for that. As the company enters the demands, the list of suitable employees will get displayed on the screen.
